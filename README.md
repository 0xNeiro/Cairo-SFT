Here an implementation initiave of Semi-fungible Tokens also known as SFTs in Cairo.

Like a NFT, SFTs contains metadata but some of them are fungible in a certain way. To be more precise, a way to fungible NFT is to classify them by their features that could then make them same. We could image a pool of differents person with same origin, however, they are not identical.
